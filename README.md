## 🧬 9. Component Design & Atomic Design Principles

### What Is Atomic Design?

**Atomic Design** is a methodology introduced by Brad Frost that structures user interfaces into five hierarchical levels:

1. **Atoms**: Basic building blocks like buttons, inputs, and labels.
2. **Molecules**: Combinations of atoms functioning together, such as a search form comprising an input and a button.
3. **Organisms**: Complex components formed by groups of molecules and/or atoms, like a header section with navigation and a logo.
4. **Templates**: Page-level structures that place components into a layout, defining the content structure.
5. **Pages**: Specific instances of templates populated with real content, representing the final UI.

This approach promotes consistency, scalability, and reusability in UI development.
